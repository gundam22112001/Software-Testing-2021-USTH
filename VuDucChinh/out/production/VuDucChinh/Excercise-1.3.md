#Excercise 1.3

###What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

Answer:

- The thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization
that testing can show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. 
This lets us accept the fact that whenever we use software, we incur 
some risk, so that is what we mean by saying that "level 3 thinking is
that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk".
- For the What risk question.The risk may be small and the consequences 
unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catastrophic
- We can try to minimize the risk, but we can't reduce it to zero.
Because the risk is always there.
