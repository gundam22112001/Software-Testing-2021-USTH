###Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability and observability


Answer:

Inheritance can make following input and output difficult, since
you have to keep track of multiple class definitions to be able 
to get an overview of what is going on when the tests are running
.Sometimes there will be inheritance graphs so long that,it feels
like going up and down like a yo-yo.
