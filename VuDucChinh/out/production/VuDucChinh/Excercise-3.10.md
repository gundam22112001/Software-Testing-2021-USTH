###Replace each occurrence of a set with a list in the JUnit theory removeThenAddDoesNotChangeSet. Is the resulting theory valid or invalid? How many of the tests that pass the precondition also pass the postcondition? Explain

Answer:

The resulting theory is definitely not valid because order 
matters in lists. Hence the JUnit theory fails.
